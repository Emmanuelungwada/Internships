# 8.	A) Cross validation
# 9.	C) Sensitivity and Specificity
# 10.	A) True 
# 11.	B) Apply PCA to project high dimensional data 
# 12.	B) It becomes slow when number of features is very large. 
#                 C) We need to iterate.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# B SECTION
# 13.	Explain the term regularization? 
# Answer:
# Regularization refers to strategies which are used to calibrate machine learning models to limit the adjusted loss feature and save you overfitting or underfitting.  Also, regularization in machine learning, refers to a set of techniques that help the machine to learn more than just memorize.
# 
# 14.	Which particular algorithms are used for regularization?
# Answer:
# 
# There are three main regularization techniques, namely: Ridge Regression (L2 Norm) Lasso (L1 Norm) Dropout.
# 
# 15.	Explain the term error present in linear regression equation? 
# 
# 
# The error time period is the distinction among the expected rate at a specific time and the price that changed into simply observed.

# Is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.
# 
# Also, A normal distribution is an arrangement of a data set in which most values cluster in the middle of the range and the rest taper off symmetrically toward either extreme.
